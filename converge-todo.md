# Converge TODOs:

- [ ] - pivot table for document related_documents
- [‚àö] - ensure all usages of @OptionalChild have a uniqueness constraint, per vapor docs
- [‚àö] - look at all migrations since 10, thinking through `unique(on:)` constraints
- [‚àö] - pivot table for document tags
- [‚àö] - table for isbns, with optional FK to edition üëç

## rando notes

- Document schema (in TS) has a "region" field, but I'm not sure if it's used anywhere,
  left it out of migration for now
- moved optional `print_size` prop from Document to Edition, i think it more correctly
  belongs there
